# Exercise 2: Simple Sums 

""" Steps:
1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value `8`.
2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value `10`.
3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
4. Print the value of the sum to the console."""

a = 8      #variable 1
b = 10     #variable 2
c = a+b    #sum of variable 1 and variable 2 stored in variable 3
print(c)   #print of the sum stored in variable 3
